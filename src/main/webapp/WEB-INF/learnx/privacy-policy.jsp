                <h3>Comments</h3>
                <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also
                    the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
                <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the
                    Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available
                    here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/"
                             target="_blank">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval of your comment,
                    your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>

                <h3>Media</h3>
                <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location
                    data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data
                    from images on the website.</p>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts
                    cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
                <p>When you log in, we will set up a cookie to save your user information and your screen display
                    choices. User cookies last for two hours. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist
                    for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>

                <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
                <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
                    Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited
                    the other website.</p>
                <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking,
                    and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction
                    with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>

                <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
                <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
                    recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a
                    moderation queue.</p>
                <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they
                    provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at
                    any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
                    edit that information.</p>

                <h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
                <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an
                    exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to
                    us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not
                    include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>

                <h3>Other privacy information</h3>
                <p>If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.</p>
